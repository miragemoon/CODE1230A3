<h1> B) Our Design</h1>
<h2>Location</h2> <p> We have chosen Little Bay as the prime location as it is not only close to the CBD and convenient in terms of access, it is also where they can regain their spiritual connection with the land, animals, sea and the sky.</p>
<p> The 8 stops mirror the idea of the Dreamtime story called 'The Rainbow Serpent.' In our case, the 'serpent' (the trains) visits each waterhole (the stops) to connect the communities and shape a new sustainable world. <br> <br>
Each of the 8 cities has been selected because of their deep history with the Aboriginal culture e.g. Bondi Beach is where an iconic Aboriginal rock carving lies; Redfern is where the Metropolitan Local Aboriginal Land Council is situated. </p>

							<h2>i) The Beacon</h2>
							<p>"The Beacon" has a prominent structure that mirrors the Indigenous' iconic landmark, Uluru. The tinted, red glass structure adopts smart technologies that allow it to control the amount of sunlight exposure being entered into the room by the automatic dimming of panels; allowing the right amount of natural lighting to enter each room. The glass facade allows individuals to connect with the land and the sea, not only on the beacon itself but to the city of Sydney below. <br> <br>

							Modern accommodations offices and shops can be found in the 'Uluru' building. The open-to-public roof makes it one of the main community areas where families can come together, light the roof-top campfire and sit around together to share stories like in the past. For those families and individuals who prefer a more traditional way of life, there is the option of residing in traditional huts built from timber and hunting grounds on the platform. <br><br>

							The station is situated underground along with more shopping centre and facilities like medical centres for the community to engage with.

							<h2>ii) The Stops</h2>
							<p> Each individual stop all draw on the history and culture of their city. Not only that they link all the areas together through a suspended railway system. This fosters an opening and diverse community, allowing not only the Indigenous communities to have high standards of living but for the wider community to be educated and accept the Indigenous culture. <br> <br>

							<h2>iii) The Walkways & Transport</h2>
							<p> The integrated suspension railway systems allow a pedestrian walkway to be created at the top. Small stalls owned by Indigenous families can be placed along the area as well as artworks that display the culture. <br> <br>

Native plants are planted to create a parkland feel, allowing the wider community to change to enjoy the area and promote health awareness through exercising and ridng a bicycle instead of using private cars. <br>
